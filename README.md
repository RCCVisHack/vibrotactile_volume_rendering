# Vibrotactile Volume Rendering for VR Scientific Presentation
* ## Description:
   * Using existing haptics in VR controllers to augment interactions w/ volume reconstructions + make scientific
presentation more accessible to blind/blind-deaf individuals
   * Jas: “During VR demos of my existing work, users have responded positively to haptic feedback when interacting with 3D buttons. The hackathon will be a fun opportunity to explore haptics for scientific presentation, which may add to my viz and art practices.”
   * Hardware: HTC Vive
